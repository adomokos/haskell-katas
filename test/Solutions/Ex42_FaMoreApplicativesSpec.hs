{-
    You can think of functions as boxes, that contain their
    eventual result.

    Applicative law: pure f <*> x = fmap f x
    In conclusion, applicative functors aren't just interesting,
    they're also useful, because they allow us to combine different
    computations, such as I/O computations, non-deterministic computations,
    computations that might have failed, etc. by using the applicative style.
