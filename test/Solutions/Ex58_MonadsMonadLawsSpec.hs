   Monad laws:

    1. Left Identity

       Take a value, put it in the default context with return
       and then feed to a function by using `>>=`, it's the same
       as just taking the value an applying the function to it.
       return x >>= f is the same as f x

       For the list monad, return puts something in a singleton list,
       the >>= implementation for lists goes over all the values
       in the list and applies the function to them.

    2. Right Identity

       If we have a monadic value and we use >>= to feed it to return,
       then the result is our original monadic value.
       m >>= return is no different than just m

    3. Associativity

       When we have a chain of monadic function application with
       >>=, it shouldn't matter how they're nested.
       (m >>= f) >>= g is just like doing m >>= (\x -> f x >> g)
