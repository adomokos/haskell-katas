    Functor typeclass is for things that can be mapped over.
    This is how it's implemented:
    class Functor f where
        fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
    f here is a type constructor
    Remember `Maybe Int` is a concrete type, `Maybe a` is type constructor.
    It takes a function from one type to the other, and a functor applied
    with one type, and functor applied with another type.

    Good old map is a functor: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
    instance Functor [] where
        fmap = map
    [] is a type constructor

    Types that can act like a box can be functors

    Maybe is a functor as well:
    instance Functor Maybe where
        fmap f (Just x) = Just (f x)
        fmap f Nothing = Nothing

    Functor wants a type constructor that takes one type and not
    a concrete type.
    Only type constructors with one params can be used in functors.

    Types that can act like a box can be functors.

    Either is a functor
    instance Functor (Either a) where
        fmap f (Right x) = Right (f x)
        fmap f (Left x) = Left x
