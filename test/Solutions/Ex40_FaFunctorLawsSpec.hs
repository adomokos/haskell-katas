    ~~The first functor law:~~
    states that if we map the `id` function over a functor, the functor that
    we get back should be the same as the original functor.
        fmap id = id

    ~~The second functor law:~~
    says the componsing two functions and then mapping the result function
    over a functor should be the same as first mapping one function over
    the functor and then mapping the other one.
