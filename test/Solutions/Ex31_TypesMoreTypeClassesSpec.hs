    Typeclasses are like interfaces. A type class defines some
    behavior, and types can behave that way.
    When we say a type is an instance of a type class, we mean
    that we can use the functions that the typeclass defines with
    that type.

{-
    Minimal complete definition for the typeclass = the minimum of functions that we
    have to implement so that our type can behave like the class advertises.
